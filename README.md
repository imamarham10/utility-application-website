# utility-application-website
A simple project containing hand-picked common utility tools used by developers in their day-to-day lives.
The project contains a variety of tools:-
i) Encoders & decoders
ii) Hash generators
iii) Color Converter
iv) Timestamp & Number base converter
v) String Utilities
vi) Timer & Stopwatch
vii) IP address finder
viii) Language Translator
This project is built using Html, JavaScript, and advanced CSS(i.e. flex, grid) and the website is completely responsive.
The hurdle which I faced during this project was making a hamburger menu for the mobile layout.
