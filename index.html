            <p class="paragraph">
                URL encoding stands for encoding certain characters in a URL by replacing them with one or more character triplets that consist of the percent character "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits. The two hexadecimal digits of the triplet(s) represent the numeric value of the replaced character.

The term URL encoding is a bit inexact because the encoding procedure is not limited to URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), but can also be applied to any other URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) such as URNs (Uniform Resource Names). Therefore, the term percent-encoding should be preferred.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Base64 encoding schemes are generally used when there is a need to encode binary information that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are developed to deal with textual information. This guarantees that the data stays unchanged without modification during transfer. Base64 is generally used in a number of applications including electronic mail via MIME, and keeping complex information in XML.

            <p class="paragraph">
                A hash function is an algorithm that can be run on data such as an individual file or a password to produce a value called a checksum.
                The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digest, or simply hashes. Hash functions are generally irreversible or one-way, which means
                you can't figure out the input if you only know the output unless you try every possible input which is called a brute-force attack.
